I am a third year Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate at [Duke University](https://pratt.duke.edu/), where I work in the [Bridgeman Lab](http://bridgeman.pratt.duke.edu/). My research interest is at the intersection of machine learning and control -- how learning can be used to improve control of complex systems and conversely how control theory can be used to improve learning processes. Currently, I aim to enforce stability and robustness on learned controllers so that they can be be used on safety critical autonomous systems -- such as medical robotics.

Previously, I received my masters in Mechanical Engineering at [Auburn University](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/), where worked in the [GPS and Vehcile Dynamics Lab (GAVLAB)](https://gavlab.auburn.edu/). My research used machine learning to aid in the modelling, classification, and estimation of uncertain systems.
