I am a second year mechanical engineering PhD student at Duke University, where I work in the [Bridgeman Lab](http://bridgeman.pratt.duke.edu/). My research interests involve using robust control theory to analyze and characterize deep learning techniques. My aim is to enforce stability and robustness on learned controllers so that they can be used on safety critical autonomous systems, such as medical robotics.

Previously, I received my masters in Mechanical Engineering at Auburn University, where I worked in on modelling and estimation of uncertain systems in the [GPS and Vehcile Dynamics Lab (GAVLAB)](https://gavlab.auburn.edu/).
