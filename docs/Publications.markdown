### Dissipative Imitation Learning for Robust Dynamic Output Feedback
#### Amy K. Strong*, Ethan J. LoCicero, Leila J. Bridgeman
#### IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2022 
#### Abstract: 
Robust imitation learning seeks to mimic expert controller behavior while ensuring stability, but current methods require accurate plant models. Here, robust imitation learning is addressed for stabilizing poorly modeled plants with linear dynamic output feedback. Open-loop input-output properties are used to characterize an uncertain plant, and the feedback matrix of the dynamic controller is learned while enforcing stability through the controller's open-loop QSR-dissipativity properties. The imitation learning method is applied to two systems with parametric uncertainty.

### Utilizing Hidden Markov Models to Classify Maneuvers and Improve Estimates of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
#### Amy K. Strong, Scott M. Martin, David M. Bevly
#### Modelling, Estimation and Controls Conference, 2021
#### Abstract:
Estimating the states of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) without the use of onboard sensors can be difficult, particularly if the UAV is performing high dynamic maneuvers. This paper examines if data driven modelling can assist in estimating UAV states, as well as classification of UAV maneuvers. A standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that uses radar measurements and a constant acceleration dynamic model is used as the baseline estimation technique for dynamic UAV maneuvers. The UAV maneuvers are then modelled as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which classify maneuvers and generate additional state information in the form of acceleration and jerk estimates. These HMM estimates are incorporated into an EKF to create a fusion EKF+HMM. This paper evaluates the robustness of the HMM classification accuracy and compares the EKF+HMM to a standard EKF using both simulated and experimental data.
