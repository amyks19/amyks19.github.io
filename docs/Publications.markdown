## Dissipative Imitation Learning for Robust Dynamic Output Feedback
### Abstract: 
Robust imitation learning seeks to mimic expert controller behavior while ensuring stability, but current methods require accurate plant models. Here, robust imitation learning is addressed for stabilizing poorly modeled plants with linear dynamic output feedback. Open-loop input-output properties are used to characterize an uncertain plant, and the feedback matrix of the dynamic controller is learned while enforcing stability through the controller's open-loop QSR-dissipativity properties. The imitation learning method is applied to two systems with parametric uncertainty.
