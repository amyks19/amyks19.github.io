I am a second year mechanical engineering PhD student at [Duke University](https://pratt.duke.edu/), where I work in the [Bridgeman Lab](http://bridgeman.pratt.duke.edu/). My research interest is at the intersection of machine learning and control -- how learning can be used to improve control of complex systems and conversely how control theory can be used to improve learning processes. Currently, I aim to enforce stability and robustness on learned controllers so that they can be be used on safety critical autonomous systems -- such as medical robotics.
